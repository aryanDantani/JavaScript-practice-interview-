## 1. Asynchronous Programming
File: `AsynchronousProgramming.js`

Asynchronous programming is a paradigm that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. This file explores concepts like:
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/Await

## 2. Closures
File: `Closure.js`

Closures are a powerful feature of JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from their lexical scope, even after the outer function has executed. This file provides examples and use cases of closures.

## 3. Higher-Order Functions
File: `HighOdringFunction.js`

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. Examples include:
- `map`
- `filter`
- `reduce`

## 4. Key Features of ES6
File: `KeyFeatureOfES6`

This file highlights important features introduced in ES6, such as:
- Arrow Functions
- Template Literals
- Destructuring
- Default Parameters
- Modules

## 5. Map and forEach
File: `MapAndForEach.js`

This file explains the difference between `map` and `forEach`, two array methods commonly used in JavaScript. It covers:
- When to use `map`
- When to use `forEach`

## 6. Methods in JavaScript
File: `MethodsOfJavaScript.js`

This file provides examples of built-in JavaScript methods for various data types, including:
- String methods
- Array methods
- Object methods

## 7. Pass by Value and Reference
File: `PassByvaleAndReference.js`

This file discusses the difference between passing by value and passing by reference in JavaScript. It includes examples to demonstrate how primitive and non-primitive data types behave during assignments and function calls.

## 8. Polymorphism
File: `polymorphism.js`

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This file provides examples of polymorphism in JavaScript, focusing on:
- Method Overriding
- Method Overloading (simulated in JavaScript)
